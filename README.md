cd M0sense_BL702_example
```
## 1. Prepare bl_mcu_sdk

We take the advice from Bouffalolab to import the [bl_mcu_sdk](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_mcu_sdk/blob/release_v1.4.5/README.md#how-to-make-sdk-as-submodule) as submodule.

You just need to type this command below after you cloned this repository.

```shell
$ git submodule update --init
```
And then wait for it to finish.

## 2. Update later~~ Sorry:)
